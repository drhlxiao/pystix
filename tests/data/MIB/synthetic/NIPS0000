#  The intention behind this synthetic parameter is to be able to add the
#  internal revision number from the version control system to the MIB files at
#  the time of the export. The result of the calculation is the same version
#  that is in the comment in the VDF table. Unfortunately, when using the SIIS,
#  there is no way to display the information from the VDF table. At the same
#  time, using a constant for a synthetic parameter will not update that
#  parameter at all. Writing `return __VERSION__` would be more concise, but
#  does not give me the intended result, either.
